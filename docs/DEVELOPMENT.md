# Maratus — Development Guide

> Looking for what Maratus *is*? See the product overview in the
> [README](../README.md). This guide covers setup, architecture, and
> internals for developers.

Multi-tenant admin console for **Maratus**, a digital-document SaaS. Stores install
printer devices that replace paper documents with a QR code customers scan. Maratus
no longer ingests or hosts document content — a caller triggers a device over the
API and passes a URL to content it hosts itself; the device renders that URL as a
QR. This repo is the admin console plus the device-facing trigger/command API —
backed by a real database, auth, object storage, and prepaid-credit billing.

## Stack

- **Next.js 16** (App Router) + **React 19** + **TypeScript** (strict), `@/*` → repo root
- **Tailwind v4** + **shadcn/ui** (style `radix-nova`) + **lucide-react**
- **recharts** charts · **next-themes** light/dark
- **Neon** (serverless Postgres) + **Drizzle ORM** over `neon-http`
- **Better Auth** (email/password + organization plugin) — `organization = tenant`
- **Cloudflare R2** (S3-compatible) for private object storage (tenant branding
  assets, firmware binaries)
- **Resend** (transactional email) · **Sentry** (optional observability)

- **Platform admin:** `admin@maratus.co` / `123456`
- **Tenant owner:** `dana@roastwell.co` / `123456`
- Org "Roastwell Coffee": 3 stores, 6 claimed devices (mixed status), 3 unclaimed
  devices (with pairing codes, ready to claim in the UI), and a starter grant of
  prepaid credits.

## Architecture

Two access tiers behind one app shell:

- **Tenant workspace** (`/tenant/*`) — a store chain manages its stores, devices,
  branding, device settings, members, analytics, reports, activity (audit log),
  and billing (prepaid credits). Scoped to the user's active organization.
- **Super Admin** (`/admin/*`) — Maratus staff (`user.role = 'platform_admin'`) see
  across all customers: overview, customers, the global device fleet, factory
  **inventory** (manufacturing registry, `/admin/inventory`), firmware releases,
  platform health, and billing (credit usage across all orgs).

Key seams:

- **`lib/data.ts`** — the single data layer. Tenant-panel functions take an
  `organizationId`; super-admin functions span all orgs. All DB→view-model
  conversions (cents→dollars, `lastSeenAt`→ISO, status derivation, activation
  time-series, credit ledger/usage rollups) happen here.
- **`lib/session.ts`** — `getContext()`, `requireTenant()`, `requirePlatformAdmin()`.
  Route-group layouts call these to gate access. `middleware.ts` is an optimistic
  cookie check at the edge; real role checks run in the layouts.
- **`lib/db/schema.ts`** — Better Auth tables + org plugin + app tables (all FK →
  `organizationId`): `tenantSettings` (incl. `archivedAt`/`archivedNote` for the
  customer-archive lifecycle), `store`, `device` (incl. `serial`), `deviceCommand`,
  `firmwareRelease`, `apiKey`, `creditBalance`, `creditLedger`, `factoryDevice`
  (the manufacturing registry, keyed by eFuse-MAC serial), plus infra tables
  (`apiIdempotency`, `rateLimit`, `auditLog`, `alert`). `organization = tenant`;
  platform admin is a user role, not a membership. Money is stored in integer
  **cents**; prepaid credits are the sole payment path.
- **Server actions** (`lib/actions/*`, route-local `actions.ts`) authorize, mutate
  via Drizzle, record an audit entry (`lib/audit.ts`, best-effort), then
  `revalidatePath`. Pure, IO-free logic is split into testable modules
  (`device-status`, `health`, `credit-usage`, `credits-overview`, …) with
  colocated `*.test.ts` (vitest).

## Device → trigger → QR flow

Trigger-only model: Maratus never sees the document content — the caller hosts it and
passes a URL.

1. **Provision** — a platform admin creates a device with a one-time pairing code.
2. **Claim** — a tenant claims it into a store (`claimDevice`), which issues a
   device key (raw key shown **once**; only its SHA-256 hash is stored) and
   consumes the pairing code. A device also self-claims by polling
   `GET /api/device/claim?code=…&serial=…` on its setup screen; if its serial was
   pre-allocated in the factory registry (see below), it **auto-claims zero-touch**
   on first contact — no code entry.
3. **Trigger** — `POST /api/v1/devices/{deviceId}/trigger`, authenticated by an
   API key with the `devices:trigger` scope plus a required `Idempotency-Key`
   header. Body `{ action: "show_qr", payload: { url } }`. The route checks device
   ownership/online status, **reserves 1 credit** (`lib/credits.ts`), and enqueues
   a `deviceCommand` row (`type: "trigger"`, `status: "pending"`).
4. **Publish, render, ack** — the trigger route publishes a `trigger` command
   on the device's MQTT `d/{deviceId}/cmd` topic (device-key auth against the
   broker, not HTTP). The device renders a QR from `payload.url`, then
   publishes `{ commandId, ok }` to `d/{deviceId}/ack`. A success ack settles
   the reserved credit; a failure or expiry releases it. A publish that fails
   fails closed — the command, reservation, and idempotency claim all unwind
   and the caller gets `503`.

Org-wide device policy (brightness / sleep / QR duration / PIN) and the
firmware manifest ride the same MQTT `cmd` topic as payload-carrying
`config-changed` / `firmware-update` commands — pushed on save and rebuilt
fresh on every publish, since they embed short-lived presigned R2 URLs. A
device asks for its config once per MQTT connection by publishing `{}` to
`d/{deviceId}/cfg/get`; it never polls on a timer. See
[`device-protocol.md`](device-protocol.md) and the machine-readable API spec
at `GET /api/v1/openapi.json`.

## Factory registry & zero-touch provisioning

For manufacturing scale, every printer is tracked in `factoryDevice`, keyed by its
immutable **eFuse-MAC serial** (12 lowercase hex — public, printed on the box;
**never** a credential). Platform admins manage it at `/admin/inventory`: import a
batch by CSV, allocate serials to a customer (+store), mark RMA, or reprint a
label QR. Lifecycle `manufactured → allocated → claimed` (+`rma`/`retired`). When
an **allocated** serial (with both org and store) first polls the claim endpoint,
it auto-claims zero-touch and mints its key in one shot — the installer only
connects Wi-Fi. A `claimed` serial never re-mints a key (hijack guard); the claim
endpoint validates the code before any DB hit and is rate-limited per-code and
per-IP. `lib/factory-registry.ts` holds the transactional registry operations;
`lib/provisioning.ts` holds the pure decision logic. Recovery from a mis-claim is
documented in [`runbooks/factory-registry-hijack-recovery.md`](runbooks/factory-registry-hijack-recovery.md).

## Customer lifecycle (offboarding & archive)

Customers are never hard-deleted — "deleting" a churned customer **archives** it
(`tenantSettings.archivedAt`), a reversible soft-delete that keeps all credit and
audit history. The admin offboard wizard (customer detail → danger zone) decides
each device's fate (return to stock → device row deleted + its registry serial
reverted to `manufactured`, re-allocatable; or leave with customer → device paused
+ serial `retired`), sweeps still-allocated serials, revokes API keys, cancels
pending invitations, freezes the credit balance, and stamps `archivedAt` last (so
the flow is idempotently re-runnable). `requireTenant` gates archived orgs out of
the tenant panel; `lib/data.ts` excludes them from KPIs/lists by default; a
server-side `isOrgArchived` guard blocks admin mutations. **Restore** un-archives
(it does not undo device dispositions or key revocations). See
`lib/actions/offboarding.ts`.

## Billing (prepaid credits)

Credits are the **only** payment path — there is no per-print invoicing or metered
subscription. Each successful device trigger consumes one credit
(reserve → settle on ack, release on failure/expiry). New orgs receive a starter
grant on signup. Tenants cannot buy credits in-app: the operator invoices customers
manually and grants (or deducts) credits from the super-admin customer page. The
`creditLedger` table is the append-only source of truth; `creditBalance` is the
running total.

## Testing

```bash
npm test
```

Pure domain logic is unit-tested with vitest (`lib/**/*.test.ts`, 48 suites /
474 tests) — device status derivation, health alerts, credit usage/overview
rollups, API-key scopes, OpenAPI/serialization, audit labels, rate limiting,
trigger actions, provisioning + factory-registry decision logic, offboarding
helpers, printer layout/geometry, timezones, and member-role rules.
