// Configuration status for transactional email, which fails SILENTLY when
// half-configured — which is exactly how it sat unnoticed for weeks.
//
// Email is the dangerous one. lib/email.ts only no-ops when RESEND_API_KEY is
// absent; with a key present it really calls Resend, and Resend really refuses
// anything sent from its shared `onboarding@resend.dev` sender to an address
// other than the account owner's. So the "configured" state and the "reaches
// customers" state are not the same thing, and nothing in the app said so.
//
// Pure (IO-free) so it stays unit-testable: the caller passes env values and,
// optionally, the domain list fetched from Resend (lib/resend-domains.ts).
